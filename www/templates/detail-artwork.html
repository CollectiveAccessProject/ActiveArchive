						<h5>About the Artwork</h5>
						Open a tall gate and pass through a narrow alley beside a "white trash" house. It is clad in white siding with old windows and an astroturf patio littered with fall leaves. Ruby slippers, at the end of legs in striped stockings, emerge from under the house. Inside, Greer Lankton recreated the Chicago apartment where she lived and worked. The walls are painted in deep colors. Stars cover the ceiling. The room is inhabited by the dolls and figures Lankton made during the course of her life – Raggedy Anns, one of whom is anorexic, a morphine addict on a cot surrounded by pill bottles. Throughout the room are very personal shrines Lankton has created, to Patti Smith, Candy Darling, to Jesus, and many others to the artist herself. Several of Lankton's figures were included in the 1995 Whitney Biennial and the 1995 Venice Biennale, but she never before had the opportunity to create a large-scale installation. Much of her work is clearly autobiographical, revealing her obsession with her own body. Born male, she became female at the age of 21. Her work has been described by critic Holland Cotter as "art of a superbly disciplined and unusually distressing beauty." Greer Lankton's It's all about ME, Not You was first shown in 1996. Unfortunately, Greer passed away after the exhibit opening and when the show closed, we put the piece in storage. Now, thanks to the generosity of the Lankton family, it has been donated to the Mattress Factory for permanent display.
						<h5>Artist Statement</h5>
						I’ve been in therapy since 18 months old, started drugs at 12 was diagnosed as schizophrenic at 19, started hormones the week after I quit Thorazine got my dick inverted at 21, kicked Heroin 6 years ago. Have been Anorexic since 19 and plan to continue and you know what I say FUCK Recovery, FUCK PSYCHIATRY Fuck it all because I’m over it. Over the roof. I’m so sick I’m dead, so from now on I take no responsibility for my actions. Oh and I was fucked up the ass by my grandfather since age 5, been brutally raped twice and have had almost every major organ in my body fail at some point. Life support is no picnic for Rhoda so don’t EVEN take me there. By the way I’m an artist and Andy Warhol was the dullest person I ever met in my life. But he’s got a museum so what do I know. Hans Bellmer is my favorite artist. Love always, GreerArtificial NatureTotal Indulgence Dolls engrossed in glamour and self abuseThe vanityThe junkieThe anorexic The chronic masturbator “Its all about ME” Not youTrapped in my own world in my H\head in my tiny tiny apartment.
